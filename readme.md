Working towards a better solution for semantically correct HTML as well as a non-intrusive grid layout and zoomable baseline

## Please Note

This is currently still in its **alpha stages**, and while I'm comfortable using it on productions site, it is not meant for wide-spread usage at this time. Consider yourself warned!

A lot of the ideas behind this are thanks to numerous articles that I have read over the past couple of years. I will attempted to document them as much as possible and put links to the various different authors that have helped me come to this idea and build it out. If you appear on here and for whatever reason don't want to be linked, please <a href="mailto:hello@jamiesonroberts.ca">contact me</a> and let me know.
